Users must feel comfortable when interacting with robots prior to mass adoption. This early-stage project involves examining several factors that may involve interactions between robots and humans.

For example, how does humanoid robot *form* impact user comfort during psHRI? Particularly with the goal of *successful ageing* in mind, are there factors that are specific to the elderly population?

By comparing participant microbehaviours, physiological signals, and questionnaire answers when performing the same task with different robots, we hope to determine if certain humanoid robot features affect user comfort in order to guide future robotic assistant designs.
