I am currently working as a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Sherbrooke in Sherbrooke, Canada. My current research arc involves different aspects of *physical and social human-robot interaction (psHRI)* with humanoid robots, particularly in multimodal attention and intention recognition related to human touch. The goal is to develop robotic assistants for *safe, comfortable, and intuitive autonomous psHRI* in the areas of home care, manufacturing, or healthcare. I am also researching the concept of *Sensor Observability Analysis*, a novel way of performing generalized kinematic analysis of distributed axial sensors on articulated robots. My past research involved automation of single cell micromanipulation, quadruped robot control, and hexapod robot leg design. I am also passionate about teaching, mentoring, and helping people become better versions of themselves.
